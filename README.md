# Library-Management-System
A Java-based application that manages library operations, including adding books, issuing books, returning books, and displaying book lists. The system tracks book status and provides a user-friendly interface for librarians to efficiently manage library resources.

Working:
1. Menu-driven interface: The system provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the library management system.
2. Book management: Users can add books, view all books, and track book status (issued or available).
3. Issue and return books: Users can issue books to borrowers and return books when they are no longer needed.
4. Display issued books: The system displays a list of all issued books.

Key Features:
1. Book class: Represents a book with attributes like book ID, name, and issue status.
2. Library class: Manages book collections, issues, and returns.
3. Storage class: Stores issue records.

Necessary Points:
1. User input validation: The system validates user input to ensure data consistency.
2. Book ID uniqueness: The system ensures that each book has a unique ID.
3. Issue status tracking: The system tracks the issue status of each book.

Use Cases:
1. Librarians: Can use the system to manage book collections, track issues, and returns.
2. Students/Researchers: Can use the system to borrow books and track their borrowing history.
3. Library management: Can use the system to monitor book availability, track circulation, and optimize library resources.

Overall, the LMS code provides a basic framework for managing library operations, with features like book management, issue and return tracking, and display of issued books.
